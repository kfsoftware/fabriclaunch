# Tutorial: Setting up a Hyperledger Fabric Network with FabricLaunch

This tutorial will guide you through the process of setting up a Hyperledger Fabric network using FabricLaunch. We'll create a network with one peer organization (Org1MSP) containing one peer and one orderer organization (OrdererOrg) containing three orderers. Then, we'll create a channel and install and deploy a chaincode.

## Prerequisites

- FabricLaunch installed and configured
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Basic understanding of Hyperledger Fabric concepts

## Step 1: Network Configuration
<!-- 
1. Create a network configuration file
2. Define the peer organization (Org1MSP)
3. Define the orderer organization (OrdererOrg)
4. Specify network parameters

```bash
# Placeholder for network configuration commands
``` -->

## Step 2: Creation of Org1MSP

### Create local CA for Org1MSP

1. Set up the CA configuration for Org1MSP
2. Generate root certificates for Org1MSP

```bash
# Placeholder for Org1MSP CA setup commands
fabriclaunch auth login
# generate a name for a consortium between important companies
export TENANT_NAME="test8"

fabriclaunch org create Org1MSP --type local
fabriclaunch org register Org1MSP --tenant ${TENANT_NAME}

export PUBLIC_IP="peer0-org1.localho.st"
fabriclaunch peer create org1-peer0 --tenant ${TENANT_NAME} --tenant ${TENANT_NAME} --mode=service --region=nyc --mspId Org1MSP \
  --externalEndpoint="${PUBLIC_IP}:7051" \
  --listenAddress="0.0.0.0:7051" \
  --chaincodeAddress="0.0.0.0:7052" \
  --eventsAddress="0.0.0.0:7053" \
  --operationsListenAddress="0.0.0.0:7054" \
  -h localhost -h "${PUBLIC_IP}"


```

### Create and launch the peer

1. Generate peer certificates using the Org1MSP CA
2. Configure the peer
3. Start the peer node

```bash
# Placeholder for peer creation and launch commands
```

## Step 3: Creation of OrdererOrg

### Create local CA for OrdererOrg

1. Set up the CA configuration for OrdererOrg
2. Generate root certificates for OrdererOrg

```bash
# Placeholder for OrdererOrg CA setup commands
```

### Create and launch the three orderers

1. Generate orderer certificates using the OrdererOrg CA
2. Configure the three orderers
3. Start the orderer nodes

```bash
# Placeholder for orderer creation and launch commands
```

## Step 4: Creation of the channel

1. Generate channel configuration transaction
2. Create the channel
3. Join the peer to the channel

```bash
# Placeholder for channel creation commands
```

## Step 5: Install and deploy the chaincode

1. Package the chaincode
2. Install the chaincode on the peer
3. Approve the chaincode for Org1MSP
4. Commit the chaincode to the channel

```bash
# Placeholder for chaincode deployment commands
```

## Step 6: Test the Network

1. Invoke a transaction on the chaincode
2. Query the ledger

```bash
# Placeholder for testing commands
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully set up a Hyperledger Fabric network using FabricLaunch, created a channel, and deployed a chaincode. This basic setup includes one peer organization (Org1MSP) with one peer and one orderer organization (OrdererOrg) with three orderers. You can expand this setup to include more organizations, peers, and complex chaincode as needed for your blockchain application.
